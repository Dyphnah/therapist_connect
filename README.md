#Instructions

Welcome to the end of Phase 3! You've learned about a lot in this unit:

Python fundamentals.
Data structures (and more recently, algorithms).
Object-oriented programming.
Object inheritance.
Class attributes and methods.
Configuring applications.
SQL fundamentals.
Table relations in SQL.
Object-relational mapping with Python.
Object-relational mapping with SQLAlchemy.
Building CLIs.
In this project, we're going to use these skills to create a CLI. We want you to display knowledge of as much from Phase 3 as you can- you won't be able to fit everything in, but we'll expect to see:

A CLI application that solves a real-world problem and adheres to best practices.
A database created and modified with SQLAlchemy ORM with 3+ related tables.
A well-maintained virtual environment using Pipenv.
Proper package structure in your application.
Use of lists, dicts, and tuples.
Appropriate and accurate implementation of an algorithm from the Data Structures and Algorithms Canvas module.

Display detailed profiles of each professional, including their qualifications, areas of expertise, contact information, and any available user reviews and ratings.

A user-friendly interface with clear prompts and messages to guide users through the search and review process.

Database that stores information about the mental health professionals, user reviews, and ratings. The database design includes the necessary tables and relationships.

burnout, prefectionism, and depression are among the major challenges facing software engineers. It is estimated that software engineering student are likely to suffer from one of those and hence I have a database for mental health professtionals 

# Therapist Connect

Therapist Connect is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help users find mental health professionals, including therapists, counselors, and psychiatrists.
